# VISIONIQ AI Dashboard 🛡️✨

Welcome to VISIONIQ! 🚀 We're turning ordinary cameras into smart, AI-powered guardians. This project is all about making advanced video analysis easy, accessible, and insightful for everyone.

## What is VISIONIQ?

In an increasingly complex world, security and operational awareness are paramount. Traditional surveillance systems often require constant manual monitoring, which is inefficient and prone to human error. VISIONIQ solves this by transforming passive video streams into active, intelligent data sources.

Our mission is to provide an intuitive and powerful tool that leverages cutting-edge AI to enhance safety, optimize operations, and deliver actionable insights. By running complex vision tasks directly in the browser, VISIONIQ democratizes access to advanced AI capabilities without requiring specialized hardware.

### In Simple Terms...
Imagine a security guard who can see everything at once, never gets tired, and can instantly tell you what's happening. That's VISIONIQ! It watches your camera feeds and points out important things, like how many people are in a room or if someone enters a restricted area.

## Getting Started in 5 Easy Steps 🏁

1.  **Login:** Access the app through the secure login page.
2.  **Explore:** Use the sidebar to navigate between the main Dashboard, Analytics, and Settings pages.
3.  **Monitor Live:** On the Dashboard, click a remote camera to see its live feed and data overlays.
4.  **Perform AI Analysis:** Select "On-Site Analysis." Choose to either start your live camera or upload an image/video to begin object detection.
5.  **Review Analytics:** Visit the Analytics page to see historical trends for crowd counts and alerts.

## Troubleshooting 🛠️

**Problem: Camera is not working or "Permission Denied" error appears.**

This usually happens when the browser is blocked from accessing the camera.

**Solution:**

2.  Click the icon. A dialog box will appear.
3.  Ensure that **"Always allow [this site] to access your camera"** is selected.
4.  Reload the page. The camera should now work correctly.
